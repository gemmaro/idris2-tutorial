"So far in our examples of dependently typed programming, type indices such "
"as the length of vectors were known at compile time or could be calculated "
"from values known at compile time. In real applications, however, such "
"information is often not available until runtime, where values depend on the "
"decisions made by users or the state of the surrounding world.  For "
"instance, if we store a file's content as a vector of lines of text, the "
"length of this vector is in general unknown until the file has been loaded "
"into memory.  As a consequence, the types of values we work with depend on "
"other values only known at runtime, and we can often only figure out these "
"types by pattern matching on the values they depend on.  To express these "
"dependencies, we need so called [*sigma "

"A note on efficiency: In order to be able to run computations on our "

"This allows us to work with proofs on `Nat` and `List` most of the time, and "

"types is that they often perform much better. This is especially critical "

"often run with `O(n)` time complexity, where `n` is the size of one of the "
"natural numbers involved, while with `Bits64`, for instance, many operations "

"many functions on natural number to use the corresponding `Integer` "
"operations at runtime. This has the advantage that we can still use proper "
"induction to proof stuff about natural numbers at compile time, while "
"getting the benefit of fast integer operations at runtime. However, "
"operations on `Nat` do run with `O(n)` time complexity and *compile "
"time*. Proofs working on large natural number will therefore drastically "
"slow down the compiler. A way out of this is discussed at the end of this "
